                    I am a principal contributor who develops and deploys Thomson Reuters’ marketing websites on the Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) platform. Accomplishments include
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                    Setting standards for how to develop software for both in-house developers and contract developers, and then institutionalising them in Confluence documents

                        <li>
                            Writing frontend user interfaces in TypeScript/React (for new websites) and ECMAScript 5 (for legacy websites)

                        <li>
                            Upgrading from AEM 6.2 to AEM 6.4 (2019), and then again from AEM 6.4 to 6.5 (2021)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Building a fully-automated Continuous Integration and Deployment infrastructure (CI/CD) in both GitLab (2019) and GitHub (2020 – Present) using GitHub Actions and Bash
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Configuring static code analysis tools like Veracode and SonarQube

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Using Sumo Logic (2019 – 2020) and Datadog (2021 – Present) to gain insights of how our websites are used by customers to drive business decisions
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Created a Docker-ised version of our Adobe Experience Manager product to share with the team. I ensure this image is always up-to-date by creating a Ruby script to run within a GitHub Action that automatically installs packages (located within an S3 bucket) into our AEM image, before uploading it to our JFrog repository.
                        </li>

                    Thomson Reuters operates a proprietary Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform for running their customers' web applications. I was responsible for adding new web stacks (Java 8 and Node.js 6); improving the stability of the system by creating a new automated testing framework; and adding new features, such as the ability to target users who belong to specific physical locations.

                    Bellroy runs an e-commerce platform to sell wallets and carry products. At Trike Apps I improved the performance of Bellroy’s platform by using a smarter caching strategy, loading slower content asynchronously, and using responsive imagery to reduce image size. I extended Liquid templates to allow designers to do A/B testing. And finally I implemented an integration with PayPal, allowing users to pay using PayPal Express Checkout without leaving the Bellroy site.
