I am the creator of [MyWedHelper.com](https://www.mywedhelper.com) a wedding platform for brides to find the perfect vendors.

This software is very well built: we hardly experience bugs. How? By writing software right, the first time around. Code that can raise exceptions is surrounded inside a Begin-Catch block in order to allow the stack to unroll. Edge cases are thought of in advance and guarded against. And invalid inputs are either protected against or are processed to become valid input. Nulls are handled where they occur rather than allowing them to propagate to other parts of the stack. This reduces the time it takes to trace through the code when nulls are generated.

My speciality lies in working on high-transaction websites and services. First I started my career working at C&D Zodiac Aerospace where I helped to maintain the company's Enterprise Resourcing Planning system.

I had my formative experience at Showcare Event Solutions. I helped build their.

By the next year, I changed jobs as the company shifted towards the use of an off-the-shelf Enterprise Resource Planning system. In 2010 I began work at Showcare Event Solutions, a SaaS provider for the conference industry. We built Libra, a magnificent web application that handled the logistics and management of many conferences all over the world. We had dozens of clients, each one bringing in thousands of users to the platform. And it worked well.

Thanks to an intelligent and benevolent team leader, I consider this to be my formative learning experience. We made technical decisions that were based on information, and we knew where to find that information. We used the MSDN reference documents and the .NET Reflector tool to decompile the .NET libraries to understand how they work internally.
